# Archipelago yaml editor webapp (heavily WIP)

Hello! This is a first-stab at a web-based editor for yaml files for configuring archipelago games.

It's currently designed around Keymaster's Keep specifically; It's functional, but has some implementation quirks & relies on uploading the original template.

### Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with Archipelago or Keymaster's Keep in any way - This is just something I made on my own. I don't have plans to maintain it or even necessarily finish it, it's provided as-is & it's continued support & availability is uncertain.
